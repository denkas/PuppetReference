</blockquote>

<p>Before you install Puppet, you should do the following tasks.</p>

<h2 id="decide-on-a-deployment-type">Decide on a Deployment Type</h2>

<p>Decide on a deployment type before installing:</p>

<h3 id="agentmaster-puppet">Agent/Master Puppet</h3>

<p>Most people should use agent/master Puppet. Although it requires a central server, it’s more convenient when updating configurations and can more easily take advantage of reporting and external data sources.</p>

<p>In agent/master Puppet, you run a central puppet master server (or servers) that hosts and compiles all of your configuration data. Other nodes run the puppet agent service, which periodically pulls their configurations from the master. Each agent will only get its own configuration, and will be unable to see how other nodes are configured.</p>

<h4 id="choose-your-puppet-master-servers">Choose Your Puppet Master Server(s)</h4>

<p>Before installing Puppet everywhere, decide which server(s) will act as your puppet master(s).</p>

<p>You should completely install and configure Puppet on any puppet masters before installing on any agent nodes. The master must be running some kind of *nix; Windows machines can’t be masters.</p>

<p>A puppet master should be a dedicated machine with a fast processor, lots of RAM, and a fast disk. It must also be reachable at a reliable hostname. You can reduce setup time on your agents by making sure the master is available at the default hostname of <code>puppet</code>.</p>

<h3 id="standalone-puppet">Standalone Puppet</h3>

<p>In standalone Puppet, every node periodically uses the puppet apply command to compile and apply its own configuration, using a full set of Puppet modules and manifests. In other words, each node requires the same files and data that the puppet master requires in agent/master Puppet.</p>

<p>This distributes the burden of compilation instead of concentrating it on a few puppet master servers, and it doesn’t require keeping the puppet master service available and responsive. The cost is that it’s more unwieldy to update your configurations, it doesn’t play as well with central reporting and external data sources, and every node can see how other nodes are configured. These tradeoffs can be worth it in certain situations (two or three nodes, 10,000 nodes, DMZ with limited LAN access), but you should consider the agent/master deployment the default.</p>

<p>You will need to come up with your own solution for distributing updated manifests, modules, and data to each node.</p>

<h2 id="check-os-versions-and-system-requirements">Check OS Versions and System Requirements</h2>

<p>See the <a href="/puppet/latest/reference/system_requirements.html">system requirements</a> for the version of Puppet you are installing, and consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your puppet master(s) should be robust dedicated servers that can handle the amount of agents they’ll need to serve.</li>
  <li>Any computers running an OS version with official packages will have an easier install path.</li>
  <li>Any computers running an unsupported OS may still be able to run Puppet, as long as the version of Ruby is suitable and the prerequisites are installed. See the <a href="/puppet/latest/reference/system_requirements.html#basic-requirements">list of supported Ruby versions and prerequisites.</a> You’ll also need to follow a more complex install path.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="check-your-network-configuration">Check Your Network Configuration</h2>

<p>In an agent/master deployment, you must prepare your network for Puppet’s traffic.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> The puppet master server must allow incoming connections on port 8140, and agent nodes must be able to connect to the master on that port.</li>
  <li><strong>Name resolution:</strong> Every node must have a unique hostname. <strong>Forward and reverse DNS</strong> must both be configured correctly. (Instructions for configuring DNS are beyond the scope of this guide. If your site lacks DNS, you must write an <code>/etc/hosts</code> file on each node.)
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> The default puppet master hostname is <code>puppet</code>. Your agent nodes can be ready sooner if this hostname resolves to your puppet master.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="check-timekeeping-on-your-puppet-master-server">Check Timekeeping on Your Puppet Master Server</h2>

<p>The puppet master server that will be acting as the certificate authority should have its system time set accurately. You should probably use NTP.</p>

<p>(If it doesn’t, it may mistakenly issue agent certificates from the distant past or future, which other nodes will treat as expired.)</p>

<h2 id="next-install-puppet">Next: Install Puppet</h2>

<p>Once these tasks are complete, you can install Puppet. Pick the link appropriate to the operating system(s) you’ll be installing on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="./install_el.html">Red Hat Enterprise Linux (and Derivatives)</a></li>
  <li><a href="./install_debian_ubuntu.html">Debian and Ubuntu</a></li>
  <li><a href="./install_fedora.html">Fedora</a></li>
  <li><a href="./install_osx.html">Mac OS X</a></li>
  <li><a href="./install_windows.html">Microsoft Windows</a></li>
  <li><a href="./install_gem.html">On Misc *nix With Gems</a> (for otherwise unsupported systems)</li>
  <li><a href="./install_tarball.html">On Misc *nix With a Tarball</a> (for otherwise unsupported systems)</li>
</ul>

<p>After installing, you’ll want to do the <a href="./post_install.html">post-install tasks</a></p>
